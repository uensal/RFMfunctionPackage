#' RFMfunction
#'
#  Description
#' Function that returns the recency, frequency and monetary value KPI.
#'
#  Detail arguments like a data description
#' @details
#' \code{data} contains the transaction data. The data set must contain a
#'             column labeled "TransDate" that is configured as dates
#'             The column "PurchAmount" specifies the total spending per purchase.
#'             The column "Customer" contains cumstomer-ids
#'
#  Arguments that are passed as input to the function
#' @param data a data object with columns TransDate, Customer, PurchAmount
#' @param weight_recency a specification for weight of recency (default value = 1)
#' @param weight_frequency a specification for weight of frequency (default value = 1)
#' @param weight_monetary a specification for weight of monetary value (default value = 1)
#'
#  Returned values with a description of what the function returns
#' @return The Customers with there groups based on the RFM calculation for a given weights \code{weight_recency} \code{weight_frequency} \code{weight_monetary}
#'
#  Examples with a set of example R code on how to use the function
#' @examples
#' data(transactions)
#' RFMfunction(transactions,60,20,20)
#'
#  Import packages that are required for using your package
#' @import data.table
#  Careful: some packages have functions with overlapping names. If this is the case,
#           only import specific functions from a package. Here, lubridate and data.table
#           share the function quarter(). To avoid conflicts, only load functions you need
#           from lubridate with @importFrom package function1 function2
#' @importFrom lubridate dmy
#'
#  Include export to make sure roxygen2 knows to create the NAMESPACE file, to make
#  the package accessible to other users
#' @export
